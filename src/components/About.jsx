                    <p>LeeAnne has been a photographer for over 10 years. Capturing all    sorts of life events from Weddings to Newborns.</p>
                    <p>Her full-time job is a caregiver, however photography is her life not just a hobby.</p>
                    <p>Life is full of moments, memorable and fleeting.  You can't get them back.  With a photograph you have something you can hold on to.  Something tangible that you can share or look at.  To LeeAnne, that is what matters.  That is the reason for getting into this adventure.</p>
                    <p>Watching a family interact with each other and capturing those special moments, like a Wedding or a birth announcement, being able to give others that ability to share that memory for years to come.</p>
                    <p>Having a passion for photography is what makes LeeAnne's pictures with more than 1000 words.</p>
